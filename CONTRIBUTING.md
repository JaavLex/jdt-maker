# Contributing

## Commit messages
1. All commit messages **must** be in english in order to be accessible by the majority
of Github users.

2. Commit messages must contain a tag at the beginning in order to have a basic overview
of what the commit does (Example : `[FEAT.] This is a feature`)

## Java code
1. All variables must be in the beginning of the code with the rest of existing variables, except
for the case of classes and functions.

2. Variables must be defined as public or private, or whatever is necessary for the code to work.
But don't make them stand out from the rest of the variables too much.

## Pull request
1. You must make pull request, don't push your modifications directly.
